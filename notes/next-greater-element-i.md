You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

### Example

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

### Solution

``` python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if nums1 == None or nums2 == None: return 
        nextGreatest = {}
        stack = []
        
        for num in nums2:
            while stack and stack[-1] < num:
                nextGreatest[stack.pop()] = num
            stack.append(num)
        
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            if nums1[i] in nextGreatest:
                nums1[i] = nextGreatest[nums1[i]]
            else:
                nums1[i] = -1
        return nums1
```
